## 🚀 Why Astro + Docker Is a Developer Dream

In a world full of JavaScript fatigue, **Astro** offers a breath of fresh air. It lets you write components using multiple frameworks (React, Lit, Svelte…) while outputting ultra-fast static HTML — perfect for blogs, docs, and landing pages.

When paired with **Docker**, you get a clean, reproducible environment and effortless deployment workflow. This post walks through how I set up [upadhyayravi.com](https://upadhyayravi.com) using this combo, with insights on design, performance, and scale.
